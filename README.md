# Neural Machine Translation for German-English on the Multi30K dataset

Multi30K is a dataset to stimulate multilingual multimodal research for English-German. It is based on the Flickr30k dataset, which contains 31,014 images sourced from online photo-sharing websites. Each image is paired with five English descriptions. The Multi30K dataset extends the Flickr30K dataset with translated and independent German sentences.

The baseline score is a Seq2Seq model using 2-layer LSTMs. Three approaches are then implemented to improve the translation quality:
* Learning rate decay
* Using CNN as encoder
* Using pre-trained word embedding

Translation quality is evaluated by BLEU score.

This notebook is based on the assignment from the course "Deep Learning in Applications" at Harbour.Space University.
